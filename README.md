# 7daytodieserveradmin
Java Based GUI Project to manage a 7 Days to Die server via Telnet connection. Requiered Allocs Server fix. (Work in Progress)

Code in Progress....

Even i have a alphaversion i will upload it...

Still on local mashine i can Connect and login to Server,
get the known Players and get the Server Datas like WorldName, Max Players, FPS etc. 

if everyone interested on this version i can upload the code earlyer.

Remember that we need a pached Server with allocs server fixes so we get a lot more telnet commands like 'lkp' (listknownplayers).
